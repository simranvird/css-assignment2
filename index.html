            <p><br>
                In the night, I lie and look up at you<br>
                When the morning comes, I watch you rise<br>
                There's a paradise they couldn't capture<br>
                That bright infinity inside your eyes<br>
                <br><br></p>
                <p> 
                
                <h6>I fly to you every night (Fly)<br>
                    Forgetting that it's just a dream<br>
                    I meet you with a smile (Meet)<br>
                    Never ending forever, baby<br>
                    You (You), you are (You are) my universe<br>
                    And I (I) just want (Just want) to put you first<br>
                    And you (You), you are (You are) my universe<br>
                    And you make my world light up inside<br>
            </h6>
                <br></p>
                <p>
                I was more at ease in the dark<br>
                In the shadows that grew long (Eyes)<br>
                And they said that we can't be together<br>
                Because, because we come from different sides</p>
                <p>
                    You (You), you are (You are) my universe<br>
                    And I (I) just want (Just want) to put you first<br>
                    And you (You), you are (You are) my universe<br>
                    And you make my world light up inside<br>
                    My universe (Do-do, do-do)<br>
                    My universe (Do-do, do-do)<br>
                    My universe (Do-do, do-do)<br>
                    (You make my world)<br>
                    You make my world light up inside<br>
                    Make my world light up inside<br>
                <br></p>
                <p>
                    What light me up are<br>
                    Stars adorned with love made of you<br>
                    In my universe, you<br>
                    Make another world for me<br>
                    Because you are my stars and my universe<br>
                    These hardships are just temporary<br>
                    Just shine as bright as you shine now<br>
                    We will follow you to adorn this long night<br>
                <br></p>
                <p>
                I fly away with you<br>
                When I'm without you, I'm crazy<br>
                Please hold my hand<br>
                We are made of each other, baby<br></p>
                <p><br>
                    My universe (Do-do, do-do)<br>
                    You, you are (You are)<br>
                    My universe (Do-do, do-do)<br>
                    I just want (Just want)<br>
                    My universe<br>
                    You, you are (You are) my universe, and I<br>
                    My universe<br>
                    <br><br></p>
